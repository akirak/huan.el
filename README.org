* huan.el
/Huàn/ (换; meaning change in Mandarin) is a tiny library for replacing a symbol at point with a predefined alternative.
It is an alternative to of [[https://github.com/ROCKTAKEY/grugru][grugru]] and [[https://gitlab.com/ideasman42/emacs-cycle-at-point/][cycle-at-point]].
** Installation
As huan is an inferior alternative to the other packages on MELPA, I probably won't submit this package to MELPA.
It is not intended for that purpose.
Add =huan.el= to your load path, or use one of the source-based package managers such as straight.el, borg, quelpa, etc.
** Configuration
If you use [[https://github.com/oantolin/embark][embark]], you can use the following snippet for integration:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (with-eval-after-load 'embark
    (define-key embark-defun-map "`" #'huan-defun)
    (define-key embark-identifier-map "`" #'huan-symbol))
#+end_src

For customization, see =huan-mode-symbols-alist=.
** Usage
The following interactive functions are available:

- =huan-defun=
- =huan-symbol=
